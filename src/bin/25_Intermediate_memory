// Basic memory
// Memory is stored using Bits: 0 and 1. Bit is a smallest unit of memory
// Computer optimized for bytes
// 1 byte == 8 contiguous bits

// ADDRESSES
// All data in memory has an "address"
// they are used to located data, they are always the same - only data changes

// Offsets
// They are used to located items at an specific address 
// offsets begin at 0
// they represent the number of bytes away from the original address
// Normally deal with indexes instead

// Recap 
// Memory used addresses and offsets
// Address are permanent, data differs 
// offset can be used to "index" into some data
